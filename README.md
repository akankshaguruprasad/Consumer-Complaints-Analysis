# Consumer Complaints Analysis
The dataset consists of complaints logged by consumers about financial products and services to companies for response. Data from those complaints help us understand the financial marketplace and protect consumers.
Other than the Consumer complaint dataset, the other dataset that could give useful information is:
1. Census Data for US population

Census Data can be useful in getting the information about number of complaints logged in each state vs the population or the area of the state. 

The list of tasks that can be performed are:
1. No of Complaints logged each Year.
2. No of Complaints logged in each Region/State
3. Does population of a state affect the no of complaints logged.
4. Which financial company has most no of complaints?
5. Which product is the most complained about? 
6. Was a Timely response given by the companies against which complaint was logged?
7. How many complaints are logged in the start of the month/year or at the end of the month/year. Is there a significant difference in both these values?

Also, all these data are segregated according to year. So, a trend can be observed whether the no of complaints every year is increasing or decreasing. Similarly, this trend can also be looked for the most/least complaints lodged against company in each State/Region.

Most of the above problem statements can be answered by performing aggregation queries on a single or merged dataset. But as these datasets consists of huge data, pre-processing of these data will be required as we wish to observe this trend based on year-wise data.

For this report, consumer complaints logged from the 01/01/2011 to 04/21/2019 is used for analysis.
